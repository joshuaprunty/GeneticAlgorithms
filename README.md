## Genetic Algorithms Simulator

A simple project in p5.js, which shows racecars attempting to complete a lap of a track drawn with complex trigonometry
Racecars have unique 'DNA' - stored as an array of randomized changes in angle of the velocity vector
Repeated generations follow a genetic algorithm wherein each car's genetic fitness value corresponds to the percent of the lap it completed before crashing
After several generations, cars begin to successfully navigate the track without hitting the walls
